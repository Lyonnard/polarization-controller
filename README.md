# polarization-controller

Design for a 3D printable polarization controller

## Instructions / notes

- Print assembly with no supports and no brim, otherwise the paddle will not rotate properly. In case One of the part misprint you can find the single STL files in this folder.

- The paddles can be too loose or to sticky depending on the 3D printer. This can be solved by using extrusion multiplier in the prints and/or some tape.

- Be careful while wrapping the fiber and using the polarization controller to not catch the fiber between paddle and support.

- Designed for SMF-28, 900um jacket, 1550nm

Put 2 loops of fiber for lambda/4
Put 4 loops of fibre for lambda/2

Typical configuration is 2 loops - 4 loops - 2 loops
